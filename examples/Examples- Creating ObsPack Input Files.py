#  ####### EXAMPLE #6: Sample SENEX and SOAS simultaneously using ObsPack  ####
# ============================================================================= 
# Suppose you want to sample GEOS-Chem at the SOAS Centerville site and  
# along the SENEX flight path during June- July of 2013. Some of the SENEX flights 
# took place on the same days as the SOAS continous ground monitoring, so 
# in example #4 and #5 above, we have a few Obspack files that are for the same date. 
# GEOS-Chem will not allow you to have multiple Obspacks files for the same date, 
# as input, so you need to combine the sampling data in those together to sample the 
# model at both. We achieve this by, FIRST, sampling at each individually, as we did 
# in the prior two examples, and then looping through out files, finding when they 
# are on the same dates, and combining that input. We can seperate them after 
# GEOS-Chem outputs stuff using the Obspack ID (they're different for SOAS/SENEX). 
 
tf= os.path.isdir(path_to_examples+'\\example6\\') # Check if folder exists...

# The files you'd pass to GEOS-Chem as input to sample SENEX AND SOAS, are now in combo_folder.
# Some files tell it to sample just SOAS, others tell it to sample both. We have a 
# function to seperate the output when it's sampled like this too! 

# Now, open a combined" file we generated  and take a peek for sanity!
